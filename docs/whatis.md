<!-- 
This R Markdown document is a template for creating documentation for RespiLens (respilens.com), 
inspired by the comprehensive and user-friendly documentation of Nextstrain (nextstrain.org).

Instructions:
1.  Replace placeholder text (like "[ADD CONTENT HERE]") with specific information about RespiLens.
2.  Customize the sections based on the actual features and data available on respilens.com.
3.  If you have screenshots or diagrams, you can embed them using standard Markdown syntax: ![Caption](path/to/image.png)
4.  Consider creating a `styles.css` file in the same directory for custom CSS if needed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
# This chunk is for global R options. 
# echo = FALSE means R code will not be shown in the output document by default.
# warning = FALSE and message = FALSE suppress warnings and messages from appearing in the output.

# Introduction to RespiLens

## What is RespiLens?
RespiLens (`respilens.com`) is a visualization platform for probabilistic forecasts in the US. Our aim is to provide interactive visualizations for the range of forecasting hubs (currently: FluSight, RSV Forecast Hub) for use by the public health community, researchers and the general public. 

RespiLens offers interactive visualizations, curated datasets, and narrative descriptions to help understand:
* Forecasts for a range of pathogens.
* How forecasts have shifted over the season.
* The performance of forecasts.
* etc. 

Some key features:
- **ability to link a certain view to a URL to share forecasts**
- static and updated everyweek
- multi view (categorical forecasts, scores, timeseries)
- multi-date on one view to compare
- any number of model

This documentation will guide you through using RespiLens, interpreting its outputs, and understanding the data and methods behind the platform.

## Who is RespiLens for?
RespiLens is designed for a diverse audience:
* **Public health professionals:** To monitor predictive forecasts generated by academic partner and inform real-time public health decision making. 
* **Researchers:** To access and visualize their own forecasts, and compare to the performance across the season and compared to other forecasting teams.
* **Policy makers:** To make data-driven decisions regarding public health strategies.
* **The public:** To gain a better understanding of respiratory pathogen dynamics and predictive forecasts.

# Getting Started

## Navigating RespiLens
The RespiLens platform is organized into several key sections, accessible from the main navigation bar:

* **Dashboard:** 
* **Reports:** Offers more detailed, curated analyses and situation reports.
* **About:** Information about the RespiLens project, team, and collaborators.
* **FAQ/Help:** Answers to frequently asked questions and further guidance.

## Quick Tour: A First Look at RespiLens
Let's take a quick tour of how you might use RespiLens.

1.  **Visit the Dashboard:** Go to `respilens.com`. The dashboard will show the default view -- the national level ensemble forecast for the most recent week of influenza forecasts in the United States from FluSight.
2.  **Explore alternative views:**
    * *[add info on different models, states, pathogens etc]*
4.  **Check for Reports:** Visit the "Reports" section to see if there are any recent analyses relevant to your interests.

# Core Concepts and Features

This section delves into the main components and visualizations you'll encounter on RespiLens.

## 1. Data Sources
Understanding the origin and nature of the data is crucial for proper interpretation.
* **Forecast Data:**
    * *[Flusight description]*
* **Surveillance Data:**
    * *[hospitalization data, etc., describe these sources.]*

## 2. Key Visualizations and Interpretations

RespiLens employs several types of visualizations to represent complex genomic and epidemiological data.

### a. State-level forecasts
Phylogenetic trees are a cornerstone of genomic epidemiology, illustrating how virus samples are related to each other.

### b. Categorical forecasts
